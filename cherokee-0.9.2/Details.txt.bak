Cherokee is a light-weight, hign-performance and open-source
Cross-platform Web server.

A concurrency bug illustrated in this case, originally 
reported by Cherokee users. Its buggy manifestation is 
log corruption, similar to that of the Apache bug #25520.


Tthe Cherokee log(buf->buf) is corrupted whenever the 
buffer index buf->len is modified between "memcpy(buf->len, size)"
and "buf->len += size".


The buggy interleaving could be:

Thread 1                         Thread 2

cherokee_buffer_add(...) {       cherokee_buffer_add(...) {
  ...                              ... 
  memcpy(buf->buf + buf->len,      memcpy(buf->buf + buf->len,
         txt, size);                      txt, size);


                                   buf->len += size;
                                   buf->buf[buf->len] = '\0';

  buf->len += size;
  buf->buf[buf->len] = '\0';
}                                }
