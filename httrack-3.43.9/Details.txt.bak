HTTrack is a offline browser utility. It allows you to 
download a World Wide Web site from the Internet to a
local directory.

when hts_cancel_file_push() in thread 2 execute before hts_create_opt()
in thread 1(though the case is rare),it may lead to a 
null-pointer dereference, crashing the program

The buggy interleaving could be:

Thread 1                       Thread 2
                              
void                          
back_launch_cmd(...)                 hts_cancel_file_push(...)
{                                    {
  ...                                  ...
  hts_init();                       
                                    
                                    
                                       lock(&opt->state);
                                       ret = hts_cancel_file_push_(opt);
                                       unlock(&opt->state);
                              
                              
global_opt=opt= hts_create_opt();       
                              
}                                   }
